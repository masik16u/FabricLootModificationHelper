- item / item tag / empty / alternatives / loot table / sequence / dynamic / group entry
- functions (there are a lot)

Won't do (or do but later):

- storage number type

- item predicate's components and predicates (sub sub sub sub predicate, awesome)

- biome tags as biome predicate in location check condition
- block state in block predicate in location check condition (not sure if that will be possible to generate, but can be done like this: '.state(StatePredicate.Builder.create().exactMatch(Properties.POWERED, true))')
- fluid state in fluid predicate in location check condition (same as block state)
- entity scores condition (idk python makes some stupid stuff with that JSON structure of scores)
- type specific predicate in entity properties condition
- nbt predicate in entity properties condition
- slots predicate in entity properties condition (also funky like entity scores condition)
- block state properties condition (I genuinely don't know how)

- loot table object entry
