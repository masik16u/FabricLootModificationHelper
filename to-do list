- item / item tag / empty / alternatives / loot table / sequence / dynamic / group entry
- functions (there are a lot)
- conditions ~19

Won't do (or do but later):

- storage number type

- match tool condition's components and predicates
- biome tags as biome predicate in location check condition
- block state in block predicate in location check condition (not sure if that will be possible to generate, but can be done like this: '.state(StatePredicate.Builder.create().exactMatch(Properties.POWERED, true))')
- fluid state in fluid predicate in location check condition (same as block state)
- fluid tags as fluid predicate in location check condition
- entity scores condition (idk python makes some stupid stuff with that JSON structure of scores)

- loot table object entry
